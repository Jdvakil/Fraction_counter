# Fraction_counter
This project reads a list of fractions from a text file and then simplifies it into its simplest form and reports the number of times a single fraction value is repeated. There are two versions of fraction counter, one is based on simple programming whereas the other version (v2) uses the concepts of object-oriented programming to have the same functionalities as V1.
